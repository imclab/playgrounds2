The field is designed to look like a big-league baseball field with lights, dugouts and bleachers. All of the surrounding pathways are ADA compliant and an adjacent sensory garden has been planted to help stimulate children with autism. Construction of the field was completed in November 2012, after just two years of planning, fundraising and tremendous community and City Council support. The spring season will begin in April 2013.

History
City Council had originally scheduled the field to be fully funded in FY2021. However, In 2010, a group of Alexandria residents formed the Miracle League of Alexandria (MLA) and told City Council that if they were to move the item to FY13 in the budget, the MLA would fundraise for a portion of the construction cost. City Council agreed to the plan and the MLA, comprised of therapeutic recreation experts, parents of special needs individuals, community activists, and local business leaders, formalized a Letter of Intent signed by the City and the MLA. 

The MLA committed to raising $135,000 with the City providing another $285,000. The actual final numbers were $150,000 in cash from the MLA, $150,000 in donated construction services from the MLA contractors, and the $285,000 from  the City. That combined effort resulted in a state of the art Miracle Field that serves as a destination for our special needs population.","The rubberized surface baseball diamond  enables special needs individuals  to play baseball, wiffle ball, and hockey.

The park was initially developed in 1955 and the play equipment, including a rocket structure with slide, spaceship climbing structure, swings, and other play toys, was installed in 1965.  Because of its rich history, central location, and functional amenities, Rocket Park is one of the most well-loved and well-used parks in the City of Grand JunctionÕs parks system. For that reason, Rocket ParkÕs play structures and amenities were in desperate need of replacement and repair. Thanks to a generous Great Outdoors Colorado grant, Rocket Park underwent a major redevelopment in 2009 and 2010. The redevelopment project included a new playground with accessible play features, pour-in-place surfacing, and 4,300 square feet of concrete paths.  The redevelopment project was identified as critical because Rocket Park was lacking in two major areas: safety and accessibility.  

With regard to accessibility, Rocket Park was not unlike other parks within the Grand Junction park system as it lacked accessible play features allowing all children to participate side by side with each other. A mother of a local child with challenges summed the need for improved accessibility into the following phrase, ""The way we see it, any child can play on a handicapped accessible play area, but itÕs very difficult for handicapped children to play in a play area that isnÕtÓ. The new playground has inclusive playground features like ramps, swing chairs, sensory toys, and pour-in-place surfacing eliminating barriers allowing children of all ages and abilities an equal opportunity to play.

The social impact of the Rocket Park redevelopment project is enormous to the community.  Children with challenges and their families are now able to take part in the vast amount of spontaneous play one can experience because of the fully accessible play environment and sidewalks at Rocket Park.  This can be directly felt by the entire community, but in particular many local schools.  A count of children in special education classes at the local school district is over 15% of total enrollment.  The state and national average remains constant at around 10%.  Orchard Avenue Elementary is the closest school to Melrose Park and uses the park on a weekly basis. Its classrooms are fully integrated; so many disabled children were routinely left on the sidelines while their peers were free to play.  In addition, the schoolÕs profoundly disabled class visits the park at least two to three times a week because of the parkÕs close proximity and accessible equipment.    

The newly accessible concrete paths and playground also impact general park users include families, businesses, individuals, and organizations that rent the two picnic shelters for a multitude of activities including birthday parties, barbeques, graduation parties, family reunions, baby showers, baptisms, anniversary parties, church picnics, potlucks, wedding ceremonies, and school field trips.","The new playground has inclusive playground features like ramps, swing chairs, sensory toys, and pour-in-place surfacing eliminating barriers allowing children of all ages and abilities an equal opportunity to play.",www.gjcity.org,Robert,NPR Survey,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In 2006, the City of Round Rock was approached by Round Rock citizens Kenneth and Dennis Seymore to consider applying for a Boundless Playground Outdoor Grant.  Although the City was not awarded the grant, the City Council realized there was a great need for a universally accessible park and added the project as a high priority project in the Parks Master Plan.

Two years later, the City was approached by Marge Tripp and Sunrise Rotary organization about installing an adaptive swing for children with autism.  While the City agreed there was a need for areas for children with autism to play, the City remembered the need expressed during the boundless playground grant application process.  With these two requests in mind, the City began development of a park plan that would provide ALL children, regardless of ability, with an opportunity to play and develop skills in a fun, outdoor environment.  With that in mind, the City Council approved using a portion of Rabb Park for the Play for All park, as well as allocating $200,000 toward park construction to get the project started.  

From there, the project grew to become a community wide effort.  Members of local civic clubs joined forces and formed the Play for All Committee and a 501 (c) (3) non-profit foundation (Play for All).  The committee met regularly to fundraise and spread awareness throughout Central Texas.  

The design for the park also became a community wide effort.  City staff included professionals and parents familiar with working with children with special needs in the design process.  A Design Task Force of 30+ people was formed which included several parents of children with special needs along with professionals from different disciplines in medical, educational, and design fields. As a result of their input, the City was able to fine tune the design to ensure the diverse needs of all children.  The park includes several pods each intended to develop specific skills for all children including Retreat Pod, Sensory Pod-Sand Box, Rock Band Pod, Rolling Hill/Performance Lawn, Sensory Pod, All Abilities Playscape, All Ability Swings and a Brushy Creek Village life skills area. The completed park is 51,000 square feet of outdoor fun for children of all abilities! 

The Play for All Foundation was able the raise more than $100,000 for the project. The Round Rock City Council stepped forward in April and authorized the remaining $300,000 needed to make the Play for All Abilities Park a reality. With the help of the community, awarded grants and in-kind donations and sponsorships from local businesses, the City was able to build a 1.3 million dollar facility for $600,000.  Major donors include the Nyle Maxwell Family of Dealerships ($25,000), Wag-a-Bag ($25,000), Seton Medical Center Williamson ($25,000), H-E-B ($25,000) and Chasco Constructors who donated construction services to help build the park. These businesses have allowed the City of Round Rock to include replicas of their businesses in the Village Pod section of the park.  This will allow kids to develop life skills in a park setting that will include a Nyle Maxwell auto dealership, Wag-a-Bag convenience store with a gas station pump as well as a Seton Medical Center facility, an H-E-B grocery store and a Chasco Constructor site.

The mission of the park is to provide a safe, fun place to play and develop new skills for children of all abilities in Round Rock and surrounding areas. The Play for All Abilities Park will serve the more than 100,000 children of Williamson County with an estimated 7,945 children with a disability.

This large gated park includes a variety of play opportunities designed to stimulate and encourage the development of several skill sets such as gross and fine motor skills, social interaction, sense of discovery, creativity and strengthening exercises. 

The park is located at 151 North A.W. Grimes Blvd.  The site is heavily shaded and tucked away from busy streets. The Brushy Creek Regional Trail will be accessible from the park (2013 construction). The trail will connect Redbud Lane/CR122 to A.W. Grimes Blvd. and connects into the Greater Lake Creek Trail System.

The award recognizes the most innovative developments and research in adaptive and assistive technology that embrace the Universal Design Principle, ultimately enabling everyone to participate and contribute in all aspects of society. When the Versluis Park Project was first conceived, the township wanted an Inclusive Design that would create a fully accessible park all residents could enjoy.  How well they succeeded was published online by the National Center on Accessibility of Indiana University in April, 2002.
