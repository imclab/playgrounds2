The field is designed to look like a big-league baseball field with lights, dugouts and bleachers. All of the surrounding pathways are ADA compliant and an adjacent sensory garden has been planted to help stimulate children with autism. Construction of the field was completed in November 2012, after just two years of planning, fundraising and tremendous community and City Council support. The spring season will begin in April 2013.

History
City Council had originally scheduled the field to be fully funded in FY2021. However, In 2010, a group of Alexandria residents formed the Miracle League of Alexandria (MLA) and told City Council that if they were to move the item to FY13 in the budget, the MLA would fundraise for a portion of the construction cost. City Council agreed to the plan and the MLA, comprised of therapeutic recreation experts, parents of special needs individuals, community activists, and local business leaders, formalized a Letter of Intent signed by the City and the MLA. 

The MLA committed to raising $135,000 with the City providing another $285,000. The actual final numbers were $150,000 in cash from the MLA, $150,000 in donated construction services from the MLA contractors, and the $285,000 from  the City. That combined effort resulted in a state of the art Miracle Field that serves as a destination for our special needs population.","The rubberized surface baseball diamond  enables special needs individuals  to play baseball, wiffle ball, and hockey.

The park was initially developed in 1955 and the play equipment, including a rocket structure with slide, spaceship climbing structure, swings, and other play toys, was installed in 1965.  Because of its rich history, central location, and functional amenities, Rocket Park is one of the most well-loved and well-used parks in the City of Grand JunctionÕs parks system. For that reason, Rocket ParkÕs play structures and amenities were in desperate need of replacement and repair. Thanks to a generous Great Outdoors Colorado grant, Rocket Park underwent a major redevelopment in 2009 and 2010. The redevelopment project included a new playground with accessible play features, pour-in-place surfacing, and 4,300 square feet of concrete paths.  The redevelopment project was identified as critical because Rocket Park was lacking in two major areas: safety and accessibility.  

With regard to accessibility, Rocket Park was not unlike other parks within the Grand Junction park system as it lacked accessible play features allowing all children to participate side by side with each other. A mother of a local child with challenges summed the need for improved accessibility into the following phrase, ""The way we see it, any child can play on a handicapped accessible play area, but itÕs very difficult for handicapped children to play in a play area that isnÕtÓ. The new playground has inclusive playground features like ramps, swing chairs, sensory toys, and pour-in-place surfacing eliminating barriers allowing children of all ages and abilities an equal opportunity to play.

The social impact of the Rocket Park redevelopment project is enormous to the community.  Children with challenges and their families are now able to take part in the vast amount of spontaneous play one can experience because of the fully accessible play environment and sidewalks at Rocket Park.  This can be directly felt by the entire community, but in particular many local schools.  A count of children in special education classes at the local school district is over 15% of total enrollment.  The state and national average remains constant at around 10%.  Orchard Avenue Elementary is the closest school to Melrose Park and uses the park on a weekly basis. Its classrooms are fully integrated; so many disabled children were routinely left on the sidelines while their peers were free to play.  In addition, the schoolÕs profoundly disabled class visits the park at least two to three times a week because of the parkÕs close proximity and accessible equipment.    

The newly accessible concrete paths and playground also impact general park users include families, businesses, individuals, and organizations that rent the two picnic shelters for a multitude of activities including birthday parties, barbeques, graduation parties, family reunions, baby showers, baptisms, anniversary parties, church picnics, potlucks, wedding ceremonies, and school field trips.","The new playground has inclusive playground features like ramps, swing chairs, sensory toys, and pour-in-place surfacing eliminating barriers allowing children of all ages and abilities an equal opportunity to play.",www.gjcity.org,Robert,NPR Survey,,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The result was an inclusive playground that provides a safe and fun environment for children of all abilities.

GameTime designed a playground with ramps throughout the play system so that children in mobility devices could explore the play space alongside their peers. There are ground level and accessible, elevated activities like interactive panels and musical instruments that encourage cooperative play.

Jacob's parents made a special commitment to increase awareness of SMA and founded the Jacob Isaac Rappoport Foundation. One of the first goals of the foundation was to raise funds for a playground that would provide a place where all children could engage in meaningful play together, including children who utilize mobility devices.

The play environment was strategically designed with equipment and surfacing that specifically addresses the physical, social, sensory, cognitive and communication needs of all children along various levels of challenge. By incorporating design features that encourage intuitive play behaviors, children can feel successful, gain confidence an be independent as the explore and learn through play.
